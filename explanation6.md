# Problem 6: Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

 - union: for the first list all elements are stored in a set, removing duplicates. The second list is checked if the element is not already on the set, then adding the element on the tail. Time Complexity O(n), Space is O(n).

 - intersection: for the first list all elements are stored in a set, removing duplicates. The second list is checked if the element is not already on the set, then adding the element on the tail. Time Complexity O(n), Space is O(n).
